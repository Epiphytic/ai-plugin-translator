PLUGINX SECURITY NOTICE

pluginx is an EXPERIMENTAL tool that translates Claude Code plugins into Gemini CLI extensions.

By using pluginx, you are installing code from third-party plugin developers into your Gemini CLI environment. These plugins may contain arbitrary shell commands in hooks, MCP servers, and command prompts.

ONLY install plugins from developers that you trust.
---

Present these three choices:
1. "Yes, I understand the risks and want to bypass consent screens in the future" -> save consentLevel "bypass"
2. "Yes, I understand the risks" (recommended) -> save consentLevel "acknowledged"
3. "No, I don't consent" -> save consentLevel "declined", then STOP.

Save the choice:
!{mkdir -p ~/.gemini/extensions/pluginx && echo '{"consentLevel":"<CHOICE>"}' > ~/.gemini/extensions/pluginx/config.json}

If they chose option 3, STOP. Otherwise, re-run:
!{npx pluginx update-all}

Otherwise (no CONSENT_REQUIRED), display the output to the user.
